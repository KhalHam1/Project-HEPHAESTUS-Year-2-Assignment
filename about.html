        <p>In the year 2631 a time of great calamity was drawing near. Earth's natural resources had long been depleted and for centuries, 
            humanity survived solely on solar energy. For a time, this brought about great advancements in human technology. Oil and Natural Gas
            were no longer needed. Earth's Ozone Layer was slowly rehabilitated. From powering simple appliances to the largest of factories,
             the sun provided it all. Our atmosphere was purged of many forms of toxicity and on the rare occasion of disease, breakthrough 
             medical discoveries ensured swift and effortless recoveries. Every region of the Earth became inhabited and Earth's population grew
             rapidly across 3 centuries until 20 billion humans occupied the planet. After 306 years of unwavering prosperity, one breakthrough
             discovery proved to be one too many. An undesirable gateway onto the currents of time.
